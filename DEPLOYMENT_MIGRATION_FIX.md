# Deployment Migration Issue Fix

## Problem
Deployment stuck on "Generating database migrations..." phase.

## Solution
The issue is likely caused by schema conflicts. We need to:

1. **Disable automatic migrations during build**
2. **Use manual database push instead**

## Implementation

### 1. Update package.json build script
Remove automatic migration generation from build process.

### 2. Use db:push instead of migrations
This bypasses migration conflicts and directly pushes schema changes.

### 3. Manual migration approach
- Run `npm run db:push` manually after deployment
- This forces schema synchronization without migration conflicts

## Status: FIXING NOW
