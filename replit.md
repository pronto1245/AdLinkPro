# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## UI/UX Design Rules (ВАЖНО - соблюдать во всех будущих изменениях):
- Все кнопки с иконками ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО должны иметь атрибут title с подсказкой на русском языке
- Подсказки должны кратко описывать действие кнопки (например: "Копировать URL", "Удалить оффер", "Редактировать")
- Использовать цветовое кодирование иконок для разных действий (синий - копирование, зеленый - успех, красный - удаление, фиолетовый - просмотр)
- Hover-эффекты с соответствующими цветными фонами для улучшения UX
- Цветовое кодирование для ролей и статусов: 
  - Роли: Супер-админ (фиолетовый), Рекламодатель (синий), Партнёр (зеленый), Сотрудник (оранжевый)
  - Рекламодатели: Привязан (индиго), Не привязан (серый)
  - Права доступа: Статистика (зеленый), Офферы (фиолетовый), Пользователи (синий), Финансы (желтый), API (красный)
