- Verified schema usage in both frontend and backend
- **100% schema consistency** - all schemas properly used
- Validated table definitions, enums, and type exports

#### Infrastructure Services Integration ‚úÖ
- Mapped **5 core infrastructure services**
- Analyzed integration levels:
  - WebSocket: 30% (needs improvement)
  - Notifications: 30% (needs improvement) 
  - Themes: 32% (needs improvement)
  - i18n: 70% (good)
  - Auth: 70% (good)

#### Component Integration Analysis ‚úÖ
- Analyzed **58 UI components** for infrastructure usage
- Tracked component dependencies and usage patterns
- Identified orphaned and underutilized components
- Mapped component-to-page relationships

### 3. Problem Identification & Solutions

#### Critical Issues Found
- **272 API calls without matching backend routes** (Critical Priority)
- **Infrastructure services underutilized** (Medium Priority)
- **23 orphaned pages** requiring connection or removal
- **15 dead modules** identified for cleanup

#### Actionable Solutions Table
Created comprehensive problems and solutions table with:
- **Priority levels** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Effort estimation** and **timeline planning**
- **Specific implementation steps**
- **Impact assessment** for each issue

### 4. Generated Documentation

#### Integration Analysis Report (69KB)
- **Executive summary** with key metrics
- **Detailed problems table** with 318 identified issues
- **Dead modules list** with cleanup recommendations
- **Technical recommendations** by category

#### Integration Problems Table (7KB)  
- **Prioritized action items** with effort estimates
- **21 critical missing backend routes** detailed
- **Implementation roadmap** by phases
- **Team-specific action items**

#### Comprehensive Integration Guide (8KB)
- **Integration status overview** with 77% score
- **Detailed analysis by category**
- **Phase-by-phase implementation plan**
- **Success metrics and monitoring guidance**

### 5. Automated Tools & Scripts

#### npm Scripts Added
```bash
npm run audit:integration    # Basic integration audit
npm run audit:verbose       # Detailed audit with verbose output  
npm run audit:problems      # Generate problems and solutions table
npm run audit:full         # Complete integration analysis
```

#### Supporting Scripts
- **integration-audit.mjs** - Enhanced audit engine (2000+ lines)
- **generate-problems-table.mjs** - Problems table generator  
- **integration-demo.mjs** - Demo script showcasing capabilities

### 6. Testing & Validation
- Created **comprehensive test suite** for audit functionality
- **Integration demo script** showing full capabilities  
- **Validated all analysis phases** working correctly
- **Confirmed 318 problems identified** with detailed solutions
