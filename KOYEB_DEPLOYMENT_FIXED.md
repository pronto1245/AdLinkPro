# Koyeb Deployment Guide - Fixed

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### ✅ Issues Resolved:

1. **Server Configuration Fixed:**
   - Updated `server/index.ts` to properly import and use `registerRoutes()` function
   - Fixed static file serving path from `../client/dist` to `../dist` 
   - Added essential middleware (`express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`)

2. **Middleware Import Issues Fixed:**
   - Corrected authentication middleware imports across multiple files
   - Fixed `requireAuth` export in authorization middleware
   - Resolved syntax errors in error handling blocks (`_error` vs `error`)

3. **CustomDomainService Verification:**
   - **No issues found** - the code in `storage.ts` was already correct
   - `CustomDomainService.verifyDomain(domainId)` is properly wrapped in the `verifyCustomDomain` method
   - The service imports and method calls work correctly

### ✅ Deployment Ready:

The application now successfully:
- ✅ Serves frontend from unified application  
- ✅ Provides all API routes (`/api/auth`, `/api/me`, `/api/offers`, etc.)
- ✅ Handles authentication endpoints correctly
- ✅ Builds successfully for production
- ✅ Starts without syntax or import errors

## Koyeb Deployment Instructions

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
3. **Set required environment variables in Koyeb:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=8000
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string
   ```

4. **The application will serve:**
   - Frontend: `http://your-domain/`
   - API: `http://your-domain/api/*`
   - Health: All endpoints respond correctly

## Validation Completed

- ✅ Frontend builds and serves correctly
- ✅ Backend API routes functional  
- ✅ Authentication system working
- ✅ Static file serving operational
- ✅ Error handling properly implemented
- ✅ Production build process successful

The application is now ready for Koyeb deployment with both frontend and backend served from a single unified application.
